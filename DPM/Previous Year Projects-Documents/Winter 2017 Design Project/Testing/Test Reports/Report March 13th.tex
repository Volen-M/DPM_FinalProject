	\section{Experiment 1}
	\paragraph{Hardware Version:}Mark III - Catapult with gears.
	\paragraph{Software Version:}Specially created software for testing. It would just spin up the motors.
	
	\paragraph{Procedure:} This is identical to our previous catapult experiments. The only difference was that the arm was connected to a gear instead of directly to the motor. The gear would be turned by the motor. We expected this would limit the arm sway induced by the structure of the motor.
	\paragraph{Results:} The effect of the change on the side to side sway was negligible. The gears introduced other problems, however. The gears would constantly slip due to large acceleration of the motors.
	
	\paragraph{Notes:} The battery voltage was 8.0 volts.
	
	\section{Test 1}
	\paragraph{Hardware Version:}Mark III - Catapult type with elastics
	\paragraph{Software Version:}Specially created software for testing. It would just spin up the motors
	
	\paragraph{Procedure:} The launcher was placed on the field, and made to fire the ball. This would verify the feasibility of the design. The test is purely qualitative.
	\paragraph{Expected Results:} The launcher would be able to fire at a distance of 8 tiles.
	\paragraph{Results:} The distance fired was 4 tiles.
	
	\paragraph{Notes:} The battery voltage was 8.0 volts.
		
	\section{Test 2}
	\paragraph{Hardware Version:}Mark III - Rotating Wheel Launcher type
	\paragraph{Software Version:}Specially created software for testing. It would just spin up the motors
	
	\paragraph{Procedure:} The launcher was placed on the field, and made to fire the ball. This would verify the feasibility of the design. The test is purely qualitative.
	\paragraph{Expected Results:} The launcher would be able to fire at a distance of 8 tiles.
	\paragraph{Results:} The distance fired was 2 tiles.
	
	\paragraph{Notes:} The battery voltage was 8.0 volts.
